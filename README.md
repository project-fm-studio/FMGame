Freddy Katina and Mia Katina are cats who team up with the questionable, arrogant, and annoying robot dog with a large hatred for King Dragonite, King Pup to put an end to King Dragonite who kidnapped SuperKat and stole the Ruby of Creation, threatening Gatto Isle's existence! Play as the cat duo, with Freddy, the brave ginger cat who has the ability to extend his claws, you can beat up your enemies with style! Mia, on the other hand, is the timid white tabby. She can extend her whiskers to grab enemies and objects, though being less atletic than Freddy, she can throw with power!

Get ready for cat action when the sprite-based adventure of Freddy and Mia releases for PC in Holiday 2025!
