This is the source code for my little adventure game that I'm working on, *Freddy and Mia*. Releasing late 2025.

Freddy Katina and Mia Katina are cats who team up with the questionable and arrogant robot dog King Pup to put an end to King Dragonite who kidnapped SuperKat and stole the Ruby of Creation. Play as the cat duo, with Freddy, the brave ginger cat who has the ability to extend his claws, you can beat up your enemies with style! Mia, on the other hand, is the timid one. She can extend her whiskers to grab enemies and objects, though being less atletic than Freddy, she can throw with power!
